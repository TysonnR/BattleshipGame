# Battleship Game (Java)

A two-player Battleship game built using core Java, featuring a colorized command-line interface, randomized AI ship placement, difficulty modes, and turn-based gameplay. This project was built as a collaborative effort during my **Intro to Computer Science III** course.

## 🚀 Features

- Classic 10x10 Battleship board layout
- AI ship placement with collision detection
- Player-driven ship placement with input validation
- Turn-based gameplay with win detection and visual feedback
- Two difficulty levels:
  - Easy: AI selects random positions
  - Hard: AI always hits ships (miss once, and you've already lost!)
- Colored console output for improved readability

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Java (OOP)
- CLI-based UI
- No external libraries

## 🧑‍💻 My Contributions

- Wrote & designed the `Board.java` logic, including ship placement, player input, checking sunk ships, and win condition checks
- Wrote & desginged the AI ship placement and game loop logic in `Game.java`
- Collaborated with two group members on structure, testing, and gameplay tuning

## 📁 Files

- `Game.java` – Main gameplay loop, AI logic, attack handling
- `Board.java` – Player/AI board logic, ship placement, win checking
- 'Main.java' – Game entry point; difficulty selection, game restart logic, user input validation

## 📚 What I Learned

- Java object-oriented programming (classes, inheritance, encapsulation)
- Designing interactive console applications
- Working with multidimensional arrays and coordinate systems
- Defensive programming and validating user input
- Group collaboration and iterative testing practices
